# PPPAR
Files for GNSS precise point positioning (PPP) with ambiguity resolution
## Goal
GNSS PPP with ambiguity resolution
* Support ionospheric-free combinations and uncombined/raw models
* Support multiple carrier frequency signals
* Support multiple GNSS systems
* Support real-time applications
## Status
GPS ionospheric-free PPP with ambiguity resolution
* phase bias product
* open source software (Under internal testing and will be availablle at this repository)
